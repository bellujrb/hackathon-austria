## 🧪 Testing Plan

Flutter's unit testing framework allows for quick and reliable testing. Below is a unitary testing plan based on the file structure and Flutter.

### `lib/`

#### `module/home`

- `home_module.dart`
    - Test if the module initializes correctly.
- `infra/models/home_model.dart`
    - Test JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `infra/services/home_service.dart`
    - Test API interactions for expected outcomes.
- `presenter/screens/home/home_screen.dart`
    - Test UI rendering and interactions.
  
#### `module/welcome`

- `welcome_module.dart`
    - Test if the module initializes correctly.
- `infra/models/welcome_model.dart`
    - Test JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `infra/services/welcome_service.dart`
    - Test API interactions for expected outcomes.
- `presenter/screens/welcome/welcome_screen.dart`
    - Test UI rendering and interactions.

#### `core/`

- `core/extensions/build_context_utils.dart`
    - Test context extension methods.
- `core/styles/colors.dart` & `core/styles/text_styles.dart`
    - Visual tests (Manual).

### `test/`

- `widget_test.dart`
    - Write widget tests for major interactive UI components.

To run tests, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter test
```

For more in-depth testing, you can also run integration tests to simulate user interactions across multiple screens.
